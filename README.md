SawyerHopkins.github.jekyll
===========================

The Jekyll files for the local generated SawyerHopkins.github.io project.

GitHub pages runs Jekyll in the --safe mode which prevents me from running my custom category plugins. To get about this problem I have created two seperate projects:


SawyerHopkins.github.jekyll

and

SawyerHopkins.github.io


The first is the raw jekyll scripting. I have this here as reference for anyone interested in how I generated my pages. The later is the live website. This is created by local execution of the Jekyll (and plugin scripts) on the files in the SawyerHopkins.github.jekyll project.
